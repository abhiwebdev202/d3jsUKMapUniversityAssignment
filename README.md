# d3jsUKMapUniversityAssignment

For this assighnment I have created 3 files. 

index.html for the html elements: which contains the divs, input and button elements to display on the web browser.

style.css, the stylesheet to add style to the html elements.

script.js, the javascript file in which the code is written to plot the UK map using d3.js and javascript.
