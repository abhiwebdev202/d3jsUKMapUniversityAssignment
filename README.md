# d3jsUKMapUniversityAssignment

For this assighnment I have created 3 files. 

index.html for the html elements: which contains the divs, input and button elements to display on the web browser.

style.css, the stylesheet to add style to the html elements.

script.js, the javascript file in which the code is written to plot the UK map using d3.js and javascript.

In the html file along side the div which contains the map, I have added 3 buttons and a stepped input field. The input field takes the value of number of towns from the JSON feed and plots that exact number of towns on the map. It does that each time we press the added button "Refresh Towns" and plots different towns each time. The other two buttons are for zooming in and out function, so we can use zoom on this map. It also contains div element which contain the map title and an aside element inside the map div which contains all the buttons, the input field and a few h tags.

In the stylesheet some html elements are styled using the element name and few of them are selected through their ids.
